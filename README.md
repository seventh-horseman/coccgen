# Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition Character Generator

The Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition Character Generator is a tool that is aimed mostly at Keepers. It is a tool to quickly create lifelike characters / investigators / NPCs. That said, players are also welcome to use the generator if they want random characters. However, currently the generatoin process is random, and users cannot tweak all the decisions that are made during the generation process. 

## Preview version

The current version is in preview. 

This is a public preview, which means I decided to make the program available to anyone interested. But not all features are ready or implemented. This github repository is used to track the issues (feature requests, plans, bugs, questions, etc) for the program. If you have an idea or a bug report to submit, check out the issues here. 

## Release plan

Currently the character generator is in a "it is ready when it is ready" mode, I have not made any commitments when this would be ready.

## Why Windows only?

Please do not submit issues to make this available on platform X. The current version started as sort of a prototype for the character generating engine, and so it runs on Windows only. 

Rest assured, I have also evaluated and I am still evaluating other platforms I might make this available on. 

* If you can't wait for a MacOS version to become available, you may post your enthusiastic comments [here](https://github.com/seventh-horseman/coccgen/issues/2).
* If instead you think this should work on mobile devices (iOS/iPadOS/Android), then post your comments and ideas [here](https://github.com/seventh-horseman/coccgen/issues/3)

I am currently not considering any other ports. This might change with time.
